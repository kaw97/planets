cold and dark but everything is my favorite color
the monolyth is neat though
the two moons may be a problem for Lon Cheney
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
an ill-considered change
I'll be getting additional sleep while I'm on Mars
yeti will enjoy the cold environment on mars
it will remind him of home
